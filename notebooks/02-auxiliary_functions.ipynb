For example, the binary cross entropy in PyTorch has a `BCEWithLogits` and a `BCELoss` implementation. When possible, you use the former, as it ensures numerical stability by taking advantage of $\\log$ of very small numbers. For example when multiplying by likelihoods, you can end up with rounding errors due to a loss in number precision: for $p_a = 10^{-5}$ and $p_b = 10^{-7}$, you preserve the precision by doing $p_a \\times p_b$ in $\\log$ space, which would be $(-5) + (-7)$ in $\\log_{10}$, as opposed to $10^{-12}$.\n",
